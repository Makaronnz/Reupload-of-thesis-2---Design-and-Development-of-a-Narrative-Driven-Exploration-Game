# Reupload-of-thesis-2---Design-and-Development-of-a-Narrative-Driven-Exploration-Game
The project aims to develop a 2D exploration game using the Unity engine. The core focus will be on integrating complex storytelling and world-building elements into the gameplay mechanics.The project will involve:

-Creating a cohesive game world with its own lore and visual identity (using Photoshop/Figma for assets and UI).

-Implementing interactive narrative branches where player choices affect the outcome.

-Developing technical systems for dialogue, inventory, and environment interaction using C#, Python and Unity.

Why?

I chose this project because it combines my technical skills in game development with my passion for narrative design. From a technical perspective, creating a "playable" entertainment system requires a deep understanding of software architecture, UI/UX design, and resource management. Academically, this project allows me to analyze how world-building affects user engagement and "playability," which is a key area in modern software and entertainment systems.
